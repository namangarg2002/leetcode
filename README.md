# DSA Learning Journey with C++

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning journey! I am learning various DSA concepts using C++ and solving LeetCode problems daily to strengthen my understanding. This project aims to track my progress and help others who are also learning DSA with C++.

## About this repository

In this repository, you will find:
- **C++ solutions to LeetCode problems**: Every day, I solve a new problem from LeetCode to reinforce my knowledge of DSA.
- **Learning progress**: As I learn new topics like arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms, I will continue to update my solutions here.
- **Reference for DSA concepts**: Each LeetCode problem is solved using a specific DSA concept, so you can check the code to learn how these concepts work in practice.

## How I'm learning

1. **Learning via online course**: I am enrolled in an online course to learn DSA concepts and their application in C++.
2. **Daily LeetCode problem-solving**: I solve problems from LeetCode every day to keep sharpening my skills.
3. **Implementing algorithms**: Each new algorithm I learn, I try to implement it in C++ to better understand its working.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching

## Progress Updates

I update my progress regularly in this repository to reflect what I have learned and the problems I have solved.
